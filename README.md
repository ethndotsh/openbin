# Openbin

Openbin is a Pastebin clone that takes notes & code sharing to the next level, by taking advantage of both a CLI and a web editor. We built it for the 8th Supabase Launch Week hackathon, attempting to solve issues we face often while trying to share snippets and code with friends and colleagues. The app is built using Go for the CLI and Next.js, Tailwind, TypeScript and `shadcn/ui` for the web editor. We take advantage of a whole lot of Supabase products, including the Database, Auth, Storage and the brand new Resend email integration.
